## Fixes

* Improve how GearMenu handles cooldowns on ChangeMenu and GearMenuSlots

**Note:** A lot of the configuration has changed and is moved to each individual GearBar. This also includes the setting of Keybindings.

## Migration

After the update to 2.0.0 GearMenu will attempt to migrate your current configuration to a new dynamic GearBar. This includes all GearSlots and their respective Keybinding.

**Note:** If for some reason the migration failed make sure to go to `Interface Options` -> `Addons` -> `GearMenu` -> `GearBarConfiguration` and fix or remake a new GearBar
